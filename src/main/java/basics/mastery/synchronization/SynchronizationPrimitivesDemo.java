/**
 * Comprehensive Java Synchronization Primitives Masterclass
 * 
 * This extensive demonstration covers the complete spectrum of Java synchronization 
 * mechanisms, from basic synchronized blocks to advanced coordination primitives.
 * Each section provides practical examples with real-world scenarios to illustrate
 * when and how to use different synchronization approaches.
 * 
 * Educational Structure:
 * 
 * Level 1: Fundamental Locking Mechanisms
 * ========================================
 * 1. synchronized keyword - Basic mutual exclusion with monitor locks
 * 2. ReentrantLock - Advanced lock with timeout, fairness, and interruptibility
 * 3. ReentrantReadWriteLock - Optimized for read-heavy workloads
 * 4. StampedLock - High-performance lock with optimistic reads (Java 8+)
 * 
 * Level 2: Advanced Coordination Primitives
 * ==========================================
 * 5. CountDownLatch - One-shot coordination for startup/shutdown scenarios
 * 6. CyclicBarrier - Multi-phase coordination for iterative algorithms
 * 7. Semaphore - Resource pooling and rate limiting
 * 8. Phaser - Dynamic participant coordination with phase advancement
 * 
 * Key Learning Objectives:
 * - Understand performance characteristics of different locking mechanisms
 * - Learn when to choose each synchronization primitive based on use case
 * - Master thread coordination patterns for complex concurrent systems
 * - Develop intuition for deadlock-free concurrent algorithm design
 * - Experience the evolution from basic synchronization to modern patterns
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - synchronized: JVM-optimized, but limited flexibility
 * - ReentrantLock: More features, slightly higher overhead
 * - ReadWriteLock: Excellent for read-heavy scenarios
 * - StampedLock: Best performance for read-heavy with occasional writes
 * - CountDownLatch: Single-use, very efficient for startup coordination
 * - CyclicBarrier: Reusable, ideal for iterative parallel algorithms
 * - Semaphore: Flexible resource management with configurable fairness
 * - Phaser: Most flexible, supports dynamic participation
 * 
 * Thread Safety Patterns Demonstrated:
 * - Monitor pattern (synchronized methods/blocks)
 * - Lock-based protection with timeout handling
 * - Reader-writer patterns for concurrent data structures
 * - Optimistic concurrency with validation
 * - Producer-consumer coordination
 * - Barrier synchronization for parallel algorithms
 * - Resource pooling with admission control
 * - Dynamic phase-based coordination
 * 
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Understanding of Java threading fundamentals
 * - Familiarity with race conditions and thread safety concepts
 * - Basic knowledge of concurrent programming challenges
 * 
 * Advanced Topics Covered:
 * - Lock fairness and its impact on performance

    /**
     * Traditional synchronized keyword demonstration
     * 
     * The synchronized keyword provides the most basic form of mutual exclusion
     * in Java, using intrinsic locks (monitor locks) built into every object.
     * 
     * Key Characteristics:
     * - Built into the JVM, highly optimized
     * - Automatic lock acquisition and release (via try-finally semantics)
     * - Reentrant (same thread can acquire the same lock multiple times)
     * - No timeout or interrupt support
     * - Block-structured (must release in reverse order of acquisition)
     * 
     * Use Cases:
     * - Simple mutual exclusion scenarios
     * - When you need guaranteed lock release (exception safety)
     * - Performance-critical code where JVM optimizations matter
     * - Legacy code or when simplicity is preferred
     * 
     * Performance Notes:
     * - JVM can apply lock elision, biased locking, and other optimizations
     * - Generally faster than explicit locks for uncontended scenarios
     * - Can lead to blocking if fairness is required

     * - Timeout-based lock acquisition (tryLock with time limit)

     * in many scenarios.
     * 
     * Lock Modes:
     * - Optimistic Read: Non-blocking read that validates data consistency
     * - Pessimistic Read: Traditional blocking read lock
     * - Write: Exclusive write lock
     * 
     * Optimistic Read Pattern:
     * 1. Acquire optimistic read stamp
     * 2. Read data non-atomically
     * 3. Validate stamp (check if writes occurred)
     * 4. If invalid, fall back to pessimistic read

     * - High-performance data structures with frequent reads
     * - When read latency is critical
     * - Scenarios where reads rarely conflict with writes
     * - Performance-sensitive concurrent algorithms

     * - Parallel task completion (wait for all workers to finish)
     * - Batch processing coordination (wait for all batches to complete)
     * - Testing synchronization (coordinate test execution)

     * CyclicBarrier for multi-phase coordination
     * 
     * CyclicBarrier enables multiple threads to synchronize at common barrier points,
     * making it ideal for parallel algorithms that proceed in phases.
     * 
     * Key Features:
     * - All threads must reach the barrier before any can proceed
     * - Reusable (cyclic) - can be used for multiple phases
     * - Optional barrier action runs when all threads arrive
     * - Broken barrier state handling for error scenarios
     * 
     * Common Patterns:
     * - Parallel algorithms with synchronization points
     * - Multi-phase computations (collect, process, aggregate)
     * - Iterative algorithms requiring synchronization between iterations
     * - Simulation systems with discrete time steps
     * 
     * Use Cases:
     * - MapReduce-style parallel processing
     * - Scientific computing with synchronized phases
     * - Game engines with synchronized frame processing
     * - Distributed consensus algorithms
