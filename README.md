## üìã Module Descriptions

### üîí **Synchronization Primitives**
Deep dive into 8 different synchronization mechanisms:
- `synchronized` keyword and intrinsic locks
- `ReentrantLock` with timeout and fairness
- `ReadWriteLock` for read-heavy workloads
- `StampedLock` with optimistic reading
- `CountDownLatch` for service coordination
- `CyclicBarrier` for multi-phase computation
- `Semaphore` for resource pool management
- `Phaser` for dynamic participant coordination

### üöÄ **Modern Concurrency (Java 21+)**
Explore cutting-edge concurrency features:
- **Virtual Threads**: Lightweight, efficient threading
- **Structured Concurrency**: Coordinated task lifecycle
- **Scoped Values**: Context propagation without ThreadLocal
