- **Performance note**: Much better for read-heavy workloads

**4. StampedLock Demo**
- **Watch for**: Optimistic reads vs pessimistic reads
- **Success rate**: How often do optimistic reads succeed?
- **Understanding**: Lock-free reading when possible

#### ü§ù **Section 2: Coordination Primitives**

### üöÄ Module 4: Modern Concurrency Deep Dive

#### **Prerequisites**
- Java 21+ installed
- Understanding of traditional threading concepts
- Familiarity with CompletableFuture

#### **Virtual Threads Section**
```java
// Key concepts to understand:
// 1. Virtual threads are cheap - millions possible
// 2. Platform threads are expensive - thousands maximum
// 3. Blocking operations don't block carrier threads
```

**What to observe:**
- **Memory usage**: Compare virtual vs platform thread overhead
- **Scalability**: How many concurrent tasks can each handle?
- **Performance**: Throughput under different load patterns

#### **Structured Concurrency Section**
```java
// Key benefits:
// 1. Coordinated lifecycle - parent controls children
// 2. Error propagation - failures bubble up properly  
// 3. Resource cleanup - automatic cancellation
```

**What to observe:**
- **Error handling**: How failures in child tasks are managed
- **Cancellation**: Automatic cleanup when parent scope closes
- **Debugging**: Cleaner stack traces and error reports

### üìÅ Module 3: Parallel File Processing Analysis

#### **Performance Comparison Framework**

The lab compares three approaches:

1. **Sequential Processing**
   - Baseline for comparison
   - Single-threaded execution
   - Predictable but slow

2. **Thread Pool Processing**
   - Traditional concurrent approach
   - Fixed number of platform threads
   - Good for CPU-bound tasks

3. **Virtual Thread Processing**
   - Modern approach using Project Loom
   - Extremely lightweight threads
   - Excellent for I/O-bound tasks

#### **Metrics to Analyze**

```
üìä Key Performance Indicators:
- Throughput: Files processed per second
- Memory Usage: Heap and native memory consumption
- CPU Utilization: Efficiency of processor usage
- Scalability: Performance under increasing load
```

#### **Questions for Analysis**
- Which approach scales best with file count?
- How does memory usage differ between approaches?
- When would you choose each implementation?
- What are the trade-offs in complexity vs performance?

### **Navigation Tips**

```
üéØ Menu Navigation:
- Enter numbers 1-15 to select modules
- Enter 0 to exit the program
- Each module provides detailed explanations
- Press Enter to continue between sections
```

### **System Information Display**

The program shows:
- **Java Version**: Confirms compatibility
- **Available Processors**: Affects concurrency demonstrations
- **Max Memory**: Impacts performance characteristics
- **Current Time**: For timing analysis

### **Error Handling**

If you encounter errors:
1. **Class Not Found**: Some modules may require specific Java versions
2. **Compilation Issues**: Run `./gradlew build` to recompile
3. **Memory Issues**: Increase JVM heap size with `-Xmx4g`

## üî¨ Experimentation Guidelines

### **Making Modifications**

Feel free to experiment by:

1. **Changing Thread Counts**
   ```java
   // Modify these constants in the demo files:
   private static final int THREAD_COUNT = 4;  // Try different values
   private static final int ITERATIONS = 1000; // Adjust workload
   ```

2. **Adjusting Timing**
   ```java
   // Change sleep durations to observe different behaviors:
   Thread.sleep(100); // Try different values: 50, 200, 500
   ```

3. **Adding Logging**
   ```java
   // Add your own debugging output:
   System.out.printf("[%s] Your custom message%n", 
                     Thread.currentThread().getName());
   ```

### **Performance Testing**

To get meaningful results:
- **Warm up the JVM**: Run tests multiple times
- **Use consistent load**: Keep other applications minimal
- **Measure multiple times**: Take averages of several runs
- **Vary parameters**: Test with different thread counts and workloads

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue**: Program won't start
```bash
# Solution: Rebuild the project
./gradlew clean build
java -cp build/classes/java/main io.mastery.MainApplication
```

#### **Issue**: OutOfMemoryError
```bash
# Solution: Increase heap size
java -Xmx4g -cp build/classes/java/main io.mastery.MainApplication
```

#### **Issue**: Virtual threads not working
```bash
# Check Java version (needs 19+ with preview, or 21+ stable)
java --version
# If using Java 19-20, enable preview features:
java --enable-preview -cp build/classes/java/main io.mastery.MainApplication
```

#### **Issue**: Performance inconsistency
- Run multiple iterations to warm up the JVM
- Close other applications to reduce system load
- Use consistent system configuration between runs

### **Getting Help**

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check Java version compatibility**
2. **Verify all files compiled successfully**
3. **Review console output for specific error messages**
4. **Try running individual modules to isolate problems**
